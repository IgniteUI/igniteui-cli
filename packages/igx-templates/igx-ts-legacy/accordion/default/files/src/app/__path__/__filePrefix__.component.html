                We have moved to a subscription-based pricing model for all our developer tools. This makes it easier
                for you to manage your license subscriptions and allows us to provide a better level of service for you.

                We updated our pricing and packages to provide you with flexible options and the best value. This
                includes <a href="https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui">Ignite UI </a>(formerly Ignite UI for
                JavaScript) which includes all of our JavaScript framework
                components for web development, including: Angular, ASP.NET (Core and MVC), Blazor, JQuery, React and
                Web Components), as well as Infragistics Professional, Infragistics Ultimate, our Ultimate UI products.

                We also offer multi-year subscriptions options with a built-in discount, so you can see the value up
                front. With these updates we are confident that we are providing the best platforms and the best price.

                    Changes to Ignite UI Product & Packaging</a>

                The pricing has been updated for all products and packages. So, all new or additional licenses will be
                sold based on our new pricing and packages. All existing license agreements will be honored and renewed
                based upon the current agreement.

                For Ignite UI customers, we are moving away from NPM for licensed packages. The current NPM packages
                will be replaced with packages that include a “Trial Version” watermark. Licensed packages for Ignite UI
                will be available from our cloud hosted ProGet server.

                Any version of Infragistics software which you have downloaded can continue to be used perpetually.
                Access to download any new or previous versions through our customer portal and package feeds will
                require maintaining an active subscription by continuing to renew it.
