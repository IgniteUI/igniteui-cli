## Installation

Install the npm package as a global module:

```bash
npm install -g igniteui-cli
```

## Usage
The main entry point is `igniteui` and is also aliased as `ig`. Both can be used interchangeably to call available commands. Check out our [Wiki documentation](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/wiki) for more details.

### Step by step
To get a guided experience through the available options, simply run:

```bash
ig
```

Upon creation, project will be automatically loaded in the default browser.
**NOTE**: If that doesn't happen the port may be already in use. Ports vary for different project types, see the description for the [`ig start`](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/wiki/Start) command for details on default ports.


### List the available commands.

```bash
ig help
```
### Generating projects and adding components

Create a new project passing name, framework and style theme.
```bash
ig new <project name> --framework=<framework> --type=<proj-type> --theme=<theme>
```
This will create the project and will install the needed dependencies.

Parameters besides name are optional. Framework default to "jquery", project type defaults to the first available in the framework and theme to the first available for the project. For more information visit [ig new](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/wiki/New) Wiki page.

#### Generate Ignite UI for Angular project

To create a new project with Ignite UI for Angular use [ig new](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/wiki/New#creating-ignite-ui-for-angular-applications) by specifying `angular` as framework, and optionally `igx-ts` as project type and selecting one of the [project templates](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/wiki/New#arguments):
```bash
ig new "IG Project" --framework=angular --type=igx-ts --template=side-nav
```

The `igniteui-cli` makes full use of the component definitions provided by [`igniteui/angular-templates`](../ng-schematics) package. You can find all of the available component templates in the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/general/cli/component-templates).

#### Generate Ignite UI for React project

To create a new project with Ignite UI for React use [ig new](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/wiki/New#creating-ignite-ui-for-react-applications-v400) by specifying `react` as framework and `igr-es6` as project type:
```bash
ig new "IG Project" --framework=react --type=igr-es6
```

#### Adding components
Once you have created a project, at any point you can add additional component templates using [ig add](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/wiki/Add). Running the command without parameters will guide you through the available templates:

```bash
ig add
```
Add a new component or template to the project passing component ID and choosing a name.

```bash
ig add <component/template> <component_name>
```

The ID matches either a component ("grid", "combo", "text-editor", etc) or a predefined template. Predefined templates are framework/project specific and can provide predefined views with either multiple components or fulfilling a specific use case like "form-validation", "master-detail" and so on.

For full list of supported templates in the current project you can simply run [ig list](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/wiki/List) command:
```bash
ig list
```

### Build and run
```bash
ig build
ig start
```

## Data Collection

The Ignite UI CLI tool uses Google Analytics to anonymously report feature usage statistics and basic crash reports. This data is used to help improve the Ignite UI CLI tools over time. You can opt out of analytics before any data is sent by using

```bach
ig config set disableAnalytics true -g
```
