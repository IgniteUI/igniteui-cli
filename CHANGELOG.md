# [5.0.0](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/compare/v4.4.0...v5.0.0) (2020-02-11)

New year, new versions, new packages 🎉
This update brings Angular 9 updates, major refactoring and under the hood improvements.

The Ignite UI CLI project has split into 4 more purposeful packages:
- `@igniteui/cli-core` - Shared utility and base types
- `@igniteui/angular-templates` - Ignite UI for Angular templates shared between schematics and main CLI.
- `@igniteui/angular-schematics` - 🌟 New package that brings the Ignite UI CLI experience as schematics tailored for Ignite UI for Angular and specifically to integrate with the Angular CLI.
You can install the Ignite UI for Angular Schematics globally and use them to create new projects:
	```bash
	npm i -g @igniteui/angular-schematics
	ng new --collection=@igniteui/angular-schematics
	```
	You can also use Step by step component generation:
	```bash
	ng g @igniteui/angular-schematics:component
	```
	Read more in our [official Angular Schematics & Ignite UI CLI documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/general/cli-overview).

- `igniteui-cli` And the Ignite UI CLI package as we know it, though it now carries a bit less dependencies baggage and we'll continue its diet.

> Note: Since `@igniteui/angular-templates` and `@igniteui/angular-schematics` are tied to [Ignite UI for Angular](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular) their major and minor version will be synced, and the path numbering will be related the respective CLI release.
